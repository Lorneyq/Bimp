# Bimp — Weather Forecast Web App

My pet project for my own use is a handy and beautiful web application with weather forecast. The whole project works on sending and receiving data, working with API servers. The user is offered to enter the name of his settlement, or find it by GPS coordinates, then he is provided with the most necessary information in a convenient "card", additional information is at the bottom. The user can also view the weather forecast for a week ahead, and for 3 three weeks back. [Starting with the version Bimp 2.0](https://github.com/Lorneyq/Bimp/commit/e476be29bc67ebe15563b4e54610653322030940) were added settings, and the ability to customize the application, namely: change the background, change the dark / light mode, and so on. In the future we plan to release a mobile application based on React Native. The project is frequently updated and getting better and better.
